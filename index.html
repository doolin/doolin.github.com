                    More than 15 years of coding are
                    scattered across repositories ranging from raw RCS files
                    to the latest version of Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the repositories are corporate,
                    where the code was work for hire. Others are privately
                    hosted, but there is still a lot which is publicly
                    hosted.  Links to everything publicly available will
                    be given as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story really starts with the projects. Most of this code
                    has been written to support, or implement a variety of
                    applications and software systems.
                </p>

                    In the following, each project will be summarized, and the
                    technology explained in plain English, as much as possible.

                          Finding and getting found on the web seems to get no easier even 
                          as technology advances. Semantic markup is one way to help search engines
                          understand the relevance of words and data on a web page, and hrecipe
                          is one of many semantic markup proposals, called <em>microformats</em>,
                          which are approaching standardized definitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          From a blogger's perspective, the main difficulty with microformats
                          is adding the required markup to the elements of recipe.

                        <p>
                          The Hrecipe plugin for WordPress solves the user interface problem
                          by presenting a set of form fields to the user, who enters the recipe
                          directly into the form fields.  The fields are processed by the plugin, 
                          then the correct markup for hrecipe placed on the WordPress post or page.

                            Total Immersion brought me on in March 2006 to help define a
                            way to simulate real buildings in their RealWorld platform.
                            Starting from general guidelines, I scoped out requirements,
                            then designed and built the RealWorld Building Editor. The
                            goal of this application was to allow an untrained user to
                            create a model of a real building for use in a simulation,
                            in about 45 minutes.

                        <p>
                            The design of the RealWorld Building editor lay in an intersection
                            between game level editing and computer aided design, neither of which
                            was an adequate paradigm.

                        <p>
                            Game designers think in terms of meshes, and planes limiting movement.

                            Buildings modeled using traditional CAD tools require extensive training.

                        <p>
                            The middle ground is applying simple 2D CAD to the regular geometry of
                            most common buildings. For example, since drawing a floor plan is easy, the
                            floor plan was used to "extrude" building walls into 3D, whence the
                            structure could be exported to the RealWorld simulation engine.

                                Building a sensor mote network in a mine required distributing motes on a line of
                                site network through the mine, because radio at GHz frequencies does not 
                                transmit through rock. The motes were attached to mount made from common 
                                building materials purchased at a building supply store, then manufactured
                                using a machine shop within the mine itself. After manufacturing, the mounts
                                were bolted into holes drilled in precise locations for relaying data packets
                                transmitted by each sensor.

                          Succinctly, you can't put a landslide in a laboratory, but you can put

                          Simulating the motion of large rock masses is an interesting and difficult 
                          problem. As stated, the scale of the is far too large for laboratory investigation,
                          but it's not always clear how best to simulate motion mathematically.  The problem
                          being that 1. rock masses such as mountains and landslides contain fractures, 
                          2. the properties of the mass often vary in different directions, and 3. the 
                          properties of the mass are often different in different places. Sort of like a 
                          fruit cake, where sometimes you have cake, and sometimes you have not-cake.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Variability in direction and location can be handled mathematically without too 
                          much trouble.  Fractures add a lot more complexity, because rock on each side of 
                          the fracture may move independently, and the interaction across the fracture is 
                          discontinuous in time as well as space. These discontinuities render finite element
                          models inapplicable, as finite elements are based on continuous media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Thus, discrete element modeling.  Each element - rock block - is free to move 
                          independently, interacting with each other across fracture boundaries.  The tool 
                          used in this project was an MS Windows implementation of discontinuous deformation analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The difference between discontinuous deformation analysis and the 
                          particle mechanics that you might see in video games is crucial: <em>discontinuous
                          deformation analysis is based on the physics of rock blocks and rock block interaction</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Simulations in video game engines may look real (and may result in being very close 
                            to real behavior), but physics-based systems are <em>necessary</em> for engineering practice.

                            is a world-class repository of numerical and scientific software. Much of this
                            software is based on the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS), and the 
                            Linear Algebra Packages (LAPACK).  Both BLAS and LAPACK are written in Fortran 77.
                            Using BLAS and LAPACK with other languages requires either having a wrapper
                            around the driver functions such that the calling program can link, or having 
                            BLAS and LAPACK as native source.

                            At this time, there were no Fortran compilers targeting Java. The <code>f2c</code>
                            project translated a subset of Fortran 77 to the C programming language. The GNU
                            <code>f77</code> compiler was a moving target. Thus, we decided design and build 
                            an in-house compiler, <code>f2j</code>.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>ICL's <code>f2j</code> is based on the Flex and Bison lexer and parser. While 
                            Fortran is known to be difficult to lexically analyze, by limiting our scope to 
                            the BLAS and LAPACK coding standards, we were able to generate an LR1 grammar
                            and successfully parse the entire code base.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Once parsed into an abstract syntax tree, the goto statements in the original 
                            <span class="program-name">Fortran</span> code were reduced to an appropriate 
                            combination of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements in Java. 
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                            Because Java doesn't allow internal access to array elements by pointer, indices
                            were generated to pass into Fortran routines requiring internal array access.   
                          </p>

                                    Nearly all rock is fractured at some scale, and these
                                    fractures allow fluids such as water and oil to move
                                    through rock masses.

                                    Because it's easier to see quasars at the edge of the

                                    understanding how water moves through fractured rock
                                    requires building and validating mathematical models.

                            Measuring the resistance or propensity of a rock to
                            fracture has important real world application. Rock
                            is the basis for most industrial activity.  We mine it
                            and we crush it with gross mechanical systems.  Large
                            drills. Tons of explosives. Huge metal crushing machines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything about rock is energy inefficient. Because we
                            as an industrial society use so much rock, even small
                            fractions of 1% energy improvement can save a lot of
                            money.

                            One common measure is <em>fracture toughness</em>, which
                            can be thought of as a sort of brittleness index distinct
                            from hardness.  For example, cast iron is quite hard, but
                            brittle, while many steels are softer, but much tougher.

                            In this project, Indiana limestone gathering from a quarry
                            south of Bloomington, Indiana was cored into specimens for
                            Modified Ring Testing.

                                of the ring specimens was computed using an RPL program on an HP48-SX scientific calculator. The
