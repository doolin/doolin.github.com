                    More than 15 years of coding are
                    scattered across repositories ranging from raw RCS files
                    to the latest version of Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the repositories are corporate,
                    where the code was work for hire. Others are privately
                    hosted, but there is still a lot which is publicly
                    hosted.  Links to everything publicly available will
                    be given as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story really starts with the projects. Most of this code
                    has been written to support, or implement a variety of
                    applications and software systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following, each project will be summarized, and the
                    technology explained in detail.

                            Measuring the resistance or propensity of a rock to
                            fracture has important real world application. Rock
                            is the basis for most industrial activity.  We mine it
                            and we crush it with gross mechanical systems.  Large
                            drills. Tons of explosives. Huge metal crushing machines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything about rock is energy inefficient. Because we
                            as an industrial society use so much rock, even small
                            fractions of 1% energy improvement can save a lot of
                            money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One common measure is <em>fracture toughness</em>, which
                            can be thought of as a sort of brittleness index distinct
                            from hardness.  For example, cast iron is quite hard, but
                            brittle, while many steels are softer, but much tougher.

                            In this project, Indiana limestone gathering from a quarry
                            south of Bloomington, Indiana was cored into specimens for
                            Modified Ring Testing.

                                The geometry processing for quarter-ring cross-sections
                                of the ring specimens was computed using an RPL program on an HP48-SX scientific calculator. The
                                initial parameters were extracted on a Sun4 workstation, loaded to the calculator
                                using Kermit protocol, the geometries calculated, then downloaded into the
                                Macintosh computer running the Cornell FRANC2D code.

                              Reservation occurs in fractured rock masses, and is difficult to

                            <span class="why-important">The probabilistic model developed in this study 
                              exploits the nature of regularly fractured rocks to allow

                                <p>
                                    "Solid rock" is a misnomer. It doesn't exist.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Nearly all rock is fractured at some scale, and these
                                    fractures allow fluids such as water and oil to move
                                    through rock masses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because it's easier to see quasars at the edge of the
                                    universe than it is to see 1 meter beneath our feet,
                                    understanding how water moves through fractured rock
                                    requires building and validating mathematical models.

                                    Such models help understand where groundwater is going,
                                    when it's going to get there, and what it might be carrying
                                    with it in terms of contaminants.

                            Working in an underground mine requires a number of skills beyond
                            software development. For example, everyone on the project was
                            required to undergo mine safety briefing. Parts of the mine suffer
                            from spalling, with occasional rock falls significant enough to
                            threaten safety.  Mote installation required using a number of
                            power tools to both fabricate mounts and attached the mounted
                            mote to mine walls.

                        <p>
                            Total Immersion brought me on in March 2006 to help define a
                            way to simulate real buildings in their RealWorld platform.
                            Starting from general guidelines, I scoped out requirements,
                            then designed and built the RealWorld Building Editor. The
                            goal of this application was to allow an untrained user to
                            create a model of a real building for use in a simulation,
                            in about 45 minutes.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="technology">Technology</h3>
                        <p>
                            The design of the RealWorld Building editor lay in an intersection
                            between game level editing and computer aided design, neither of which
                            was an adequate paradigm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Game designers think in terms of meshes, and planes limiting movement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Buildings modeled using traditional CAD tools require extensive training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The middle ground is applying simple 2D CAD to the regular geometry of
                            most common buildings. For example, since drawing a floor plan is easy, the
                            floor plan was used to "extrude" building walls into 3D, whence the
                            structure could be exported to the RealWorld simulation engine.
