<h1>Code.DavidDoolin.com</h1>


<p>More than 15 years of coding are 
scattered across repositories ranging from raw RCS files 
to the latest version of Git.
</p>

<p>Many of the repositories are corporate, 
where the code was work for hire. Others are privately
hosted, but there is still a lot which is publicly 
hosted.  Links to everything publicly available will 
be given as necessary.</p>


<p>The story really starts with the projects. Most of this code
has been written to support, or implement a variety of 
applications and software systems.</p>


<h2 class="msg_head">Finite element modeling</h2>

<li>Fracture mechanics: 
  
  Measuring the resistance or propensity of a rock to 
  fracture has important real world application. Rock
  is the basis for most industrial activity.  We mine it 
  and we crush it with gross mechanical systems.  Large 
  drills. Tons of explosives. Huge metal crushing machines.
  
  Everything about rock is energy inefficient. Because we 
  as an industrial society use so much rock, even small
  fractions of 1% energy improvement can save a lot of
  money. 
  
  
  
  One common measure is <em>fracture toughness</em>, which 
  can be thought of as a sort of brittleness index distinct
  from hardness.  For example, cast iron is quite hard, but
  brittle, while many steels are softer, but much tougher.
  
  In this project, Indiana limestone gathering from a quarry 
  south of Bloomington, Indiana was cored into specimens for 
  Modified Ring Testing.
  
  
  </li>

<li>Fracture flow:
  
  "Solid rock" is a misnomer. It doesn't exist.
  
  Nearly all rock is fractured at some scale, and these 
  fractures allow fluids such as water and oil to move
  through rock masses. 
  
  Because it's easier to see quasars at the edge of the 
  universe than it is to see 1 meter beneath our feet, 
  understanding how water moves through fractured rock
  requires building and validating mathematical models.
  
  Such models help understand where groundwater is going, 
  when it's going to get there, and what it might be carrying 
  with it in terms of contaminants.

</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>HP48-SX scientific calculator: The geometry processing for quarter-ring cross-sections
of the ring specimens was computed using an RPL program on an HP48 calculator. The 
initial parameters were extracted on a Sun4 workstation, loaded to the calculator 
using Kermit protocol, the geometries calculated, then downloaded into the 
Macintosh computer running the Cornell FRANC2D code.</p>

<p>Later, these analyses were ported to Abaqus running on Sparc 20 workstations.</p>

</div>

<p>Other tools included shell scripting with tsch, awk, sed and the usual 
assortment of Unix tools appropriate to the task.</p>

<p>Output was plotted to jgraph.</p>
