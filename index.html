                    More than 15 years of coding are
                    scattered across repositories ranging from raw RCS files
                    to the latest version of Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the repositories are corporate,
                    where the code was work for hire. Others are privately
                    hosted, but there is still a lot which is publicly
                    hosted.  Links to everything publicly available will
                    be given as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story really starts with the projects. Most of this code
                    has been written to support, or implement a variety of
                    applications and software systems.

                            Fracture mechanics:

                            <p>
                                Measuring the resistance or propensity of a rock to
                                fracture has important real world application. Rock
                                is the basis for most industrial activity.  We mine it
                                and we crush it with gross mechanical systems.  Large
                                drills. Tons of explosives. Huge metal crushing machines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Everything about rock is energy inefficient. Because we
                                as an industrial society use so much rock, even small
                                fractions of 1% energy improvement can save a lot of
                                money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One common measure is <em>fracture toughness</em>, which
                                can be thought of as a sort of brittleness index distinct
                                from hardness.  For example, cast iron is quite hard, but
                                brittle, while many steels are softer, but much tougher.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this project, Indiana limestone gathering from a quarry
                                south of Bloomington, Indiana was cored into specimens for
                                Modified Ring Testing.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fracture flow:

                            <p>
                                "Solid rock" is a misnomer. It doesn't exist.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nearly all rock is fractured at some scale, and these
                                fractures allow fluids such as water and oil to move
                                through rock masses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because it's easier to see quasars at the edge of the
                                universe than it is to see 1 meter beneath our feet,
                                understanding how water moves through fractured rock
                                requires building and validating mathematical models.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Such models help understand where groundwater is going,
                                when it's going to get there, and what it might be carrying
                                with it in terms of contaminants.

                        of the ring specimens was computed using an RPL program on an HP48 calculator. The
                        initial parameters were extracted on a Sun4 workstation, loaded to the calculator
                        using Kermit protocol, the geometries calculated, then downloaded into the
                        Macintosh computer running the Cornell FRANC2D code.
