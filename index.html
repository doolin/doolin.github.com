<h1>Code dot DavidDoolin dot com</h1>


More than 15 years of coding are 
scattered across repositories ranging from raw RCS files 
to the latest version of Git.

Many of the repositories are corporate, 
where the code was work for hire. Others are privately
hosted, but there is still a lot which is publicly 
hosted.  Links to everything publicly available will 
be given as necessary.


The story really starts with the projects. Most of this code
has been written to support, or implement a variety of 
applications and software systems.

HP48-SX scientific calculator: The geometry processing for quarter-ring cross-sections
of the ring specimens was computed using an RPL program on an HP48 calculator. The 
initial parameters were extracted on a Sun4 workstation, loaded to the calculator 
using Kermit protocol, the geometries calculated, then downloaded into the 
Macintosh computer running the Cornell FRANC2D code.

Later, these analyses were ported to Abaqus running on Sparc 20 workstations.

Other tools included shell scripting with tsch, awk, sed and the usual 
assortment of Unix tools appropriate to the task.

Output was plotted to jgraph.
